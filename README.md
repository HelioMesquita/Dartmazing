### Prerequisites

<!-- * [Flutter](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 11.3
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) 1.8.4
* [Bundler](https://bundler.io) 2.0.2 - Only for execute Fastlane -->

## Running the tests

<!-- For each scheme in project run some tests targets
* The visual scheme runs the snapshots tests for all views and view controllers
* The Infrastructure scheme runs the unit tests using Quick and Nimble for all network tests
* The Swiftmazing scheme runs the unit tests using Quick and Nimble for all bussiness and presentation rules
* The SwiftmazingMock scheme runs the functional tests using KIF in a mocked application
* The SwiftmazingTests scheme runs all tests 

The all tests can be run also using Fastlane just execute

```
bundle install
bundle exec fastlane tests
```

When running the tests using this command automaticaly runs [Slather](https://github.com/SlatherOrg/slather) that generates a test relatory of code coverage in xml. The relatory can be found at 

```
fastlane/slather
```

If you want to see relatory in html, modify the ```.slather.yml``` changing key ```coverage_service``` to ```html``` -->
